Lloyd Squier’s father owned and operated WDEV, a radio station where Squier began his on-air career at the age of 12. He became interested in racing at a young age, and at the age of 14, he began announcing races from the back of a logging truck at a dirt track in Vermont.</p><p>Later, in 1960, he constructed Thunder Road, a quarter-mile oval track in Barre, Vermont, and in 1965, he co-founded Catamount Stadium, another track in Milton, Vermont. In addition, in 1970, he co-founded the Motor Racing Network (MRN) with NASCAR pioneer Bill France Sr., and he served as a commentator for numerous races on the network.</p><h2>Squier Impact on NASCAR and Television</h2><p>Squier is largely recognized for getting CBS to broadcast the 1979 Daytona 500, which was the first time a NASCAR race was aired live from start to finish on national television.</p><p>Richard Petty won his sixth Daytona 500 following a last-lap wreck and a fistfight between Cale Yarborough and the Allison brothers, making the race one of the most memorable and spectacular in racing history. Squier’s vivid and entertaining race narration drew millions of viewers, which helped make NASCAR a popular sport.</p><p>Squier remained a lap-by-lap analyst for NASCAR on CBS until 1997, as well as for TBS from 1983 to 1999. He coined the phrase “The Great American Race” for the Daytona 500 and pioneered the in-car camera for the 1982 race. He also covered various sports for CBS and other networks, including skiing, golf, tennis, and boxing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Ken-Squier-Cause-of-Death-1.jpg><p>Squier left full-time broadcasting in 2014, but he stayed involved in the sport as a contributor and guest announcer.
