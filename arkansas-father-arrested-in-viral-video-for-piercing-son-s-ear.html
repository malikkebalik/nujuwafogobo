arrest Thursday for piercing his son’s ear.</p><p>The chaos began during a Tontitown Police Department welfare check after a Springdale High School resource officer reported a student telling classmates his drunk father “put him in a choke hold and shoved the piercing in his ear,” cops said <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">in a statement</a>.</p><p>Jeremy Sherland, 45, admitted to piercing his son’s ear, but refused to let officers speak to the boy — and would not answer any further questions.</p><p>Police later returned in numbers with an arrest warrant issued by the Washington County Prosecutor’s Office, which sparked the mayhem captured on video.</p><p>In the TikTok posted by Sherland’s son, four stone-faced officers were seen inside the Sherlands’ home, pinning the father against the wall and slapping handcuffs on him.</p><p>“<a href=#>I wanted my ears pierced,</a>” Sherland’s son is heard yelling at officers in the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">now-viral video</a>.</p><p>As confusion set in, Sherland’s wife ran over to the officers and repeatedly asked why they were in the house and demanded to know what cause they had to arrest her husband.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">An Arkansas father was handcuffed and arrested in his own home for piercing his underage son’s ear. <span

the door of his own house. <span class=credit>TikTok/iamnugget770</span></figure><p>“Why are you doing this,” Sherland’s son asked the officers while they were manhandling his father.</p><p>During the chaos, an officer explains to the woman that the father is being arrested for performing “body art without a license,” to which Sherland lets out an exaggerated laugh and sarcastically echoes the officer, seemingly baffled by the charges.</p><p>Officers then attempted to escort the father out of his home but Sherland put up a brief struggle — forcing police to shove him out the front door.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"></figure><p>As officers marched the irate father down the suburban street, his wife and son followed, both in total disbelief at the situation.</p><p>“It takes three cops, four cops, coming into my house with no permission. No permission and busted in my front door,” his wife screams at the cops as they move toward their vehicles with her cuffed husband.</p><p>“I wanted my ears pierced,” Sherland’s son yells at the officers as they place his dad in the patrol car.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The officers did not engage with Sherland’s wife or son as they escorted him to the patrol car. <span class=credit>TikTok/iamnugget770</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">The ear-piercing father posted bond and was released after spending two nights in jail. <span class=credit>TikTok/iamnugget770</span></figure><p>In&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arkansas, it is illegal</a>&nbsp;for artists to “perform body art<a href=#> on a person under sixteen</a> (16) years of age, regardless of parental consent.”&nbsp;</p><p>Violation of that law is a Class D felony.</p><p>Since Sherland was not a licensed artist, it was also illegal for him “to perform body art in any unlicensed facility.”&nbsp;</p><p>The dad was also charged with endangering the welfare of a minor, refusing to submit to arrest, and obstructing governmental operations.</p><p>Sherland was released on a $1,500 bond Saturday after spending two nights in the Washington County jail, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">online records</a>.</p><p>“Officers told Jeremy he was under arrest and explained the probable cause for the arrest. Jeremy refused to comply. Officers then took him into custody,” the statement read.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j21ma2xflr%2Bsrc2smKxllpbBqbHRZpirqpWowaawjKKlZq6Zp66tedWim56nXZu8s3nPopyrm5mjtG6%2FzqeqZp2Rp3w%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./clair-wuestenberg-bio-reveals-in-a-romantic-relationship-with-a-singer-boyfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Clair Wuestenberg Bio Reveals: In A Romantic Relationship With A Singer Boyfriend</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ariel-winter-news-photos-and-videos-hollywood-life.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ariel Winter News, Photos And Videos Hollywood Life</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
