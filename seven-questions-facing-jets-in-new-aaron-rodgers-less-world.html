The Jets have invested a lot of time in Wilson during the offseason as their No. 2 quarterback.</p><p>They believe Wilson has regained his confidence and made strides with Rodgers helping him along.</p><p>I think Wilson will get 3-4 weeks before the Jets would consider making a change if he struggles.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/Zach-Wilson-1.jpg><p>A: That is the question that needs to be answered now.</p><p>The Jets were working the phones on Tuesday talking to agents for players who are free agents. There are not a lot of good alternatives in September.</p><p>Joe Flacco, who spent parts of the last three seasons with the Jets, is a free agent and could make sense.</p><p>Robert Saleh made it clear whoever they sign is not coming in to compete with Wilson but to be his backup.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Q: What happens to the draft pick the Jets owe the Packers?</h2><p>A: The conditional draft pick in 2024 that the Packers will receive to complete the Rodgers trade will now be a second-round pick.</p><p>Rodgers needed to play 65 percent of the offensive snaps this season for Green Bay to receive the Jets’ first-round pick. So, this is a small silver lining for the Jets.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Q: Will Rodgers return next season?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/09/Aaron-Rodgers-4.jpg><p>A: No one knows.</p><p>Rodgers turns 40 in December and admitted he considered retirement in the offseason before deciding he wanted to play for the Jets.</p><p>You’d have to imagine the competitor in Rodgers does not want his career to end like this but is he ready for the grueling rehab?</p><p>If he does come back, Rodgers should be ready in time for next season.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Q: Does the injury affect Rodgers’ contract?</h2><p>A: No. The Jets placed Rodgers on injured reserve on Tuesday.</p><p>He will receive his $1.8 million base salary and his cap number remains $8.9 million.</p><p>The Jets did have a clause in the contract that it could be insured and presumably at least some of the money owed to Rodgers will be covered by insurance.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Q: What does this mean for the job security of Joe Douglas and Robert Saleh?</h2><p>A: It probably strengthens it unless the season comes completely off the rails.</p><p>The expectations have now been lowered.</p><p>If Saleh finds a way to win 9-10 games with Wilson as his quarterback, he may be in the Coach of the Year conversation.</p><h2 class=block-info-box__heading>What’s next for Jets after Aaron Rodgers’ season-ending injury</h2><p>The Jets got the news&nbsp;<a href=#>they were expecting</a>&nbsp;but dreading.</p><p>An MRI exam confirmed quarterback Aaron Rodgers has a torn left Achilles tendon that will require season-ending surgery, a source confirmed.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, the Jets are back to where they were a year ago, with Zach Wilson back as the starting quarterback of the New York Jets.</p><p>Here’s what’s next for the star-crossed franchise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Will Wilson get it done?</h2><ul><li>Wilson is 8-14 as a starter and has thrown 16 touchdown passes along with 19 interceptions. Quite a few of those interceptions have helped to turn potential wins into losses, and many believed if Wilson had played to the level of an average NFL quarterback last season, the Jets would have made the playoffs.</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Talent around him</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who else is out there?</h2><ul><li>Former starters&nbsp;<a href=#>Carson Wentz</a>,&nbsp;<a href=#>Matt Ryan</a>&nbsp;and ex-Jet&nbsp;<a href=#>Joe Flacco</a>&nbsp;are unsigned free agents. Journeyman Colt McCoy spent the preseason with the Cardinals and is available. GM Joe Douglas could look to make a trade.</li></ul><p><strong><a href=#>READ MORE</a></strong></p><p>As for Douglas, he could take some heat for trading for a 39-year-old quarterback, but that would be the ultimate second-guess.</p><p>No one was saying it was a bad move in April.</p><p>If Rodgers wants to come back in 2024, he surely will want the coach and GM who sold him on the Jets to be back, too.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Q: Will Rodgers still be around the team this season?</h2><p>A: Probably in a little while.</p><p>Saleh said Rodgers is “down,” which is understandable.</p><p>He also needs to undergo surgery, probably in the next few days. Once he begins recovering, the Jets would love him to be around the team and he can continue to mentor Wilson.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3JmampfqLK3sc1mqK6do6m2sLrSZp2am5mjtG62xK2qZqGeYrumw4yamKunnmK%2FsLDGnqmsZZyawLR51qippZxf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-to-maddie-hollywood-life.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened To Maddie?
