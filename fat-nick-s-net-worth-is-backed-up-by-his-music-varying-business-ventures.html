However, fame isn't the only thing that Nick has managed to earn over the course of his inspiring career—he has amassed a healthy net worth and leads a&nbsp;luxurious lifestyle.</p><h2>Nick's&nbsp;Net Worth</h2><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>A quick glance into Nick's&nbsp;social media handle is enough to get an idea of his&nbsp;luxurious lifestyle and establish that he actually has a&nbsp;healthy net worth under his belt. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He even <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">took to Instagram</a> on&nbsp;August 20, 2020, to show off his <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span>fortune</span>, as he&nbsp;held a&nbsp;bundle of cash in his hands. In the post's caption, he wrote, "Light 60 piece my opps can’t even afford a 20 piece McNuggets." That was definitely a punch in the face for someone. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>In a similar instance, Nick <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">bragged</a> about being&nbsp;rich and asked if one would choose a good-looking man over him who owned "big money." In the picture, he was&nbsp;holding&nbsp;a&nbsp;bundle of cash and a gun in his&nbsp;hands.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>So quarantine got me looking a little crazy with my hair but Im still [expletive] rich, what you want big [expletive] or big money choose wisely...</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>A School Dropout</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The rapper was interested in everything but studies while growing up in&nbsp;Miami.

Later, the rapper had to make his friend&nbsp;Pouya’s brother pretend as his counselor and convenience his dad to let him drop out.</p><p>My mom was cool with it, but my dad wouldn’t let me drop out, so Pouya’s brother’s friend had to pretend to be my counselor. He called my dad to convince him to let me drop out.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>After he eventually dropped out of school, he started selling drugs with his friend&nbsp;Pouya. But he later&nbsp;developed an interest in music and decided to pursue&nbsp;a career as a rapper.
