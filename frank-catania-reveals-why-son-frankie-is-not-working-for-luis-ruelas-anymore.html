I’ve been calling Louie and he won’t respond.'”</p><p>Gorga then asked why Ruelas didn’t give Frankie a warning, to which Frank responded, “That’s the only thing I got a problem with.”</p><p>Frank also addressed his own drama with Ruelas in real time at the reunion before the husbands joined the “RHONJ” ladies onstage with host Andy Cohen.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Frank Catania accused Luis Ruelas of leaving his son, Frankie, without a job during part two of the “RHONJ” Season 13 reunion. <span class=credit>frank.catania/instagram</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large is-resized">In a never-before-seen clip, Catania said he had a “problem” with Ruelas for how he handled the situation. <span class=credit>louiearuelas/instagram</span></figure><p>“Normally, I keep my mouth shut. Not today,” he told Gorga, Joe Benigno and John Fuda in the dressing room.</p><p>“Guys, you know as well as I do, I would never chime in. I’d never jump in on the bandwagon, but the fact that he f–cked me this year for no reason, and I did nothing but try to help him.”</p><p>Additionally, Frank blamed Ruelas for changing the dynamic in Season 13 for the worse, saying, “There have been such angry, angry arguments in this show, and it has never, ever gotten to the point it has gotten to right now. And the only thing different is Luis.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">“He f–cked me this year for no reason, and I did nothing but try to help him,” Catania said. <span class=credit>frank.catania.sr/instagram</span></figure><p>Of course, this isn’t the first time Ruelas — who married Teresa Giudice in August 2022 — has faced scrutiny for his business practices.</p><p>Last month, his company Digital Media Solutions was <a href=#>named in a harassment lawsuit</a> for allegedly passing on a woman’s phone number as a potential sales lead.</p><p>The firm has also been <a href=#>hit with at least three prior complaints</a> filed in 2021 that accused DMS of violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), according to copies obtained by Page Six.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Ruelas has come under fire for his business practices in the past. <span class=credit>Bravo</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image size-large">Teresa Giudice previously came to her husband’s defense after her brother, Joe Gorga, claimed Ruelas “screwed” him out of $250K. <span class=credit>teresagiudice/Instagram</span></figure><p>And in a March episode of “RHONJ,” Gorga alleged Ruelas <a href=#>“screwed” him out of $250,000</a> in a failed pizza oven venture.</p><p>“It got very ugly,” he said, adding, “You can do business with anyone if you go in with the trust and you’re not looking to cheat somebody.”</p><p>However, Giudice defended her husband’s involvement in the deal and claimed her brother wanted to receive 50 percent of the profits even though Ruelas put up “all the money.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiokZyytLXXZ5qopV9nfXN%2FjmltaGhnZLOzrc2kZJyZpJa7qq2Mq5yvnZGhwG7Dx7JkrKeeYrOzrc2koJ5lo6m8sbzEnWSwp6Kgtq%2BzjJ%2Bmq2Wcqra0edGunKWZo2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./indigo-white-bio-wiki-age-family-boyfriend-instagram-youtube-and-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Indigo White Bio, Wiki, Age, Family, Boyfriend, Instagram, YouTube and Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chad-buchanan-wife-body-career-relationships-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Chad Buchanan Wife, Body, Career, Relationships &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
