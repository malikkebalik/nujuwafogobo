After countless visits to hospitals and medical professionals, they finally arrived at a diagnosis in May 2021. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Ryan had Lyme disease.&nbsp;Well, the underlying condition was Lyme disease. Unfortunately, the reality star's illness had been&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">exaggerated</a>&nbsp;by mold toxins, along with the Epstein-Barr virus and long-haul COVID-19.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>And while discovering the exact illness would have been a step in the right direction to Ryan's recovery, there wasn't much that the doctors could do to treat his condition.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><h2>Finding the Answer Led to More Questions</h2><p>During an interaction with fellow&nbsp;Bachelor Nation&nbsp;members Ben Higgins and Ashley Iaconetti on their&nbsp;<span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">podcast</a>&nbsp;Almost Famous, Trista opened up about the struggles she and her husband have been going through.&nbsp;</p><p>Trying to channel her optimist self, the 48-year-old said she was thankful for having answers because not knowing what was eating away at her husband's health had been incredibly difficult.&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Although she admitted that having answers was a good thing, she also acknowledged that those answers came with a new set of questions. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Despite being grateful for knowing what the illness was, she still had to come to terms with the fact that this would be a lifelong battle for Ryan.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>She further added that Ryan was not doing particularly well on the day they shot the podcast.&nbsp;</p><p>"And he has his up days and down days," she added.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Ryan Was Still Lucky</h2><p>The absence of a formalized form of treatment for Ryan's condition made the ordeal all the more painful for the couple. In the same podcast, Trista revealed,&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>It is difficult in that there's not one medication he can take. There's not surgery he can do. So that's hard.</p><p>That being said, Ryan is actually one of the lucky ones. Despite this statement sounding morbid, it is a fact that Lyme disease usually&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">manifests</a>&nbsp;with a set of symptoms like loss of the ability to speak, walk, or use one's limbs.&nbsp;</p><p>Trista admitted to feeling lucky that the disease was localized to certain parts of Ryan's body. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Apparently, the symptoms were limited to having a bad ankle and knee coupled with occasional brain fog and unbearable fatigue.&nbsp;</p><h2>People Have Been Supportive of the Couple</h2><p>The couple, who met on the first season of&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>The Bachelorette</a>&nbsp;in 2003 and shares two kids, first came forward with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">news</a>&nbsp;of Ryan's illness in November 2020.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Trista had put up a tweet mentioning that Ryan had been struggling with something.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>At the time, the symptoms were on and off. They were not so severe that he could not do his daily chores and spend time with his family, but it was enough to know that something was wrong.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>The following month, Ryan admitted that he'd been grappling with a slew of health-related issues ever since he came back from an 18-week firefighter academy with the Denver Fire Department earlier that year.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>According to People, the couple has received a huge outpouring of love and support since they shared their story.</p><p>Trista hoped to channel that support to raise Lyme disease awareness and push for more research and hopefully a cure.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKiloa6ze9GymKdlkaOxbsDRoqqtmV2owrXAxKtloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sza-strips-down-for-skims-fits-everybody-underwear-campaign.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>SZA Strips Down For SKIMS Fits Everybody Underwear Campaign</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./randall-cobb.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Randall Cobb</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
