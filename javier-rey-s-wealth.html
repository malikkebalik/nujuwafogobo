Rey has been actively involved in the industry since 2001, and his efforts have significantly contributed to his current net worth.</p><p>His wealth has now surpassed $1 million, primarily earned through his successful acting career. Rey has received several awards throughout his career, which has also included theatrical work. As he continues to advance in his career, an increase in his wealth is expected.</p><h3>Javier Rey’s Net Worth: $1 million</h3><p>Javier began his acting journey on stage, participating in various local productions. One of his initial roles was in the play “Ubu Rei”, where he portrayed Captain Bordure, in a production that made strides in surrealism and Dadaism on stage. This propelled him into more acting opportunities, including roles in productions such as “Slaughter”, “Exercicios de Amor”, and “Game Station”, ultimately increasing his net worth and opening doors for television and film opportunities.</p><p>After a guest appearance in the series “On the Edge of the Law”, he secured a role in “Valderrei”, which significantly boosted his popularity. He continued to appear in more series, such as “Odd”, “Marisol”, and “Love in Troubled Times”. His film debut came in “8 Appointments”, a comedy directed by Rodrigo Sorogoyen.</p><p>In the following years, Rey became heavily involved in television roles, further augmenting his net worth. His appearances included “The Girl of Yesterday” and “Hispania, the Legend”. In 2010, he starred in his first short film, “The Last Sequence”, directed by Toni Bestard. This was coupled with regular appearances in series such as “Operation Malaya”, “Bandolera”, and “Isabel”, which drew inspiration from the story of Queen Isabel I of Castile.</p><p>In 2014, Rey’s role in the highly popular series “Velvet” as Mateo Ruiz Lagasca earned him a nomination for a Paramount Award. He also appeared in the film “Kiki, Love is Made”, a remake of the Australian film “The Little Death”. Additional projects include “What His Eyes Hid” and “The End of the Road”. In 2017, he reprised his role as Mateo Ruiz Lagasca in the continuation series “Velvet Collection”.</p><p>Recently, he is set to appear in a new film titled “Chess for Three” and a new series called “Farina”, in which he will portray Sito Minanco.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Javier is in a long-term relationship with actress Iris Diaz.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Filmography</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$1 million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>February 25, 1980</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Noia, Spain</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Actor</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>Spanish</td></tr><tr><td>Partner</td><td>Iris Díaz</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/javierrrey?lang=en</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/javierrrey/</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2626646/</td></tr><tr><td>Movies</td><td>Kiki, Love to Love, Not the End, Tom Little and the Magic Mirror, La Chica de Ayer</td></tr><tr><td>TV Shows</td><td>Velvet, Hispania, la leyenda</td></tr></tbody></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Actor <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=actor><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>El Alquiler</td><td>2017</td><td>Short post-production</td><td>Manu</td></tr><p><br></p></tbody></table><h3 class=toggle-head>Self <span class="fa fa-angle-down" aria-hidden=true></span></h3><table class=self><tbody><tr><th>Title</th><th>Year</th><th>Status</th><th>Character</th></tr><tr><td>Nunca es tarde</td><td>2017</td><td>TV Series</td><td>Himself</td></tr><p><br></p></tbody></table><p><br><br></p><p><br></p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmihmq6Zmr9uvsSyqmavlZa5tbSO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jerry-rice-net-worth-newsnow-nigeria.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jerry Rice Net Worth - NewsNow Nigeria</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./isaiah-washington-s-wife-jenisa-garland-scandal-marriage-controversy.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Isaiah Washington's Wife Jenisa Garland: Scandal, Marriage, &amp;amp; Controversy</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
