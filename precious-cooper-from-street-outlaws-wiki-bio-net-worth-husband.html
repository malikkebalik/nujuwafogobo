She was raised by her parents, Ricky and Sara Cooper, who ran a family business focused on roofing. She has a younger sister named Chelsea, who sometimes joins her on the show. Precious grew up in a middle-class family that valued hard work and honesty. <span data-preserver-spaces=true>The Coopers later moved to Wilson and Precious attended the Rivercrest High School located in Wilson, Arkansas.&nbsp;</span>However, It is unclear whether she joined the university.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Professional Career</span></h2><p>Precious was not always interested in street racing. In fact, she did not have much exposure to it until she was 19 years old. She used to travel to Memphis with JJ Da Boss, a renowned street racer, to watch him race and help him out with his garage. She was fascinated by the cars, the speed, and the adrenaline of the racing scene. She asked JJ to teach her how to race, and he agreed to mentor her for a year. He taught her the basics of street cars, such as checking tire pressure, strapping the cars down to the trailers, and tuning the engines.&nbsp;He also taught her how to handle the pressure and the competition of street racing.</p><p>Precious made her racing debut with an old car named “The Puddle Jumper”. She proved herself to be a fast learner and a natural racer. She soon upgraded to a more powerful car named “Ole Heavy”, which she still drives today. She challenged and defeated many male racers, earning their respect and admiration.&nbsp;She also earned the nickname of “The Queen of the Streets” for her dominance and confidence on the track.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Website-25.jpg><p>Precious joined the cast of “Street Outlaws” in season 9, which aired in 2017, <span data-preserver-spaces=true>and established herself as one of the heavy hitters of the show</span>. The show follows JJ Da Boss and his team of street racers as they compete against other teams from different cities and states. Precious is one of the few female racers on the show, and she has shown that she can hold her own against anyone.&nbsp;She has won many races. She has also gained many fans who admire her for her talent, personality, and style.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The controversy surrounding the series</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>When Street Outlaws first aired on reality TV, many were taken aback by the nature of the show. As street racing is illegal in America, many thought it was a clever ploy by the law enforcement agencies to catch the racers in one fell swoop. But the show has been going on without a hitch. Viewers speculated that the producers must have a deal in place with law enforcement agencies to make sure they get to film.</span></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Personal Life</span></h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Even though Precious is often loud and bold when she is behind the wheel, she is a very shy person in real life. As such, she has not revealed any details about her personal life. And while precious has not talked about her husband and children, fans have shared photos of precious with young children. People were quick to speculate that the young children accompanying her are her children.&nbsp;</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/thecelebsinfo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Website-27.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth</h2><p>Precious Cooper has earned a considerable amount of money from her racing career and her TV appearances.&nbsp;Her net worth is estimated to be around $500,000.
