On February 17, the&nbsp;<a href=#>former NBA star</a> stated that haircuts should cost at least $100 and that paying three figures for a professional barber is reasonable.</p><p>According to a video uploaded on Twitter by Daily Loud, Rose backed barbers and beauticians while answering reporter's questions, saying, “So first off, the minimum you are supposed to be spending for a quality barber is $100. I’m here to defend the sanctuary that is called barbers and beauticians. So many guys and people out there think y’all gon’ show up and get a fly haircut, and y’all gon’ spend $35. Y’all gon’ go to the end of the line, y’all gon’ hit up y’all barber. They gon’ send you to the voicemail, you’ll have a 1 o’clock appointment, and you are gonna get there at 1 o’clock, and somebody gon’ be sitting in the chair.”</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Who are Jalen Rose's kids?

As a result, a lot of people took to social media to express their views. His remarks also triggered an engaging discussion regarding the appropriate price for a quality haircut: One user wrote, “I’m okay with just cutting my own hair too lol.” “Jalen tripping. $100 might be cool for him but not over here. I’ll grow me a fro in a minute before I drop that much,” another added.&nbsp;</p><p>Someone wrote, “I understand but, $100 a pop? the avg man prolly needs to go twice a month, $200 plus on a haircut? for the avg joe? mannnn, y’all better learn how to groom ya’ self and stop by the shop just for conversation.” “Jalen rose is apparently speaking for the rich folks cause I’m far from broke but 100 for a cut is too much for me,” a user added. “$100 minimum?? Jalen forgot that most of us didn't play in the NBA,” yet another user remarked.&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I’m okay with just cutting my own hair too lol</p>— Burntmeat (@BaconThatBurge1) <a href=#>February 17, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Jalen tripping. $100 might be cool for him but not over here.
