He is a professional basketball player, best known for playing in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Los Angeles Clippers. He was previously a part of the Orlando Magic, and also played for Duke University during his college years. His efforts have certainly helped put his net worth to where it is today.</p><p>How rich is J. J. Redick? As of mid-2016, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $16 million, mostly earned through a successful career in basketball. According to reports, he earns an annual salary of around $7 million and has even played basketball internationally. As he continues his career his wealth will likely increase.</p><h3>J. J. Redick Net Worth $16 Million</h3><p>Redick started his pursuit of a basketball career playing at Cave Spring High School. He and his team won the Virginia state championship and he was named as the McDonald’s All-American Game MVP. By the end of high school he was considered a five-star recruit by Scout.com and was ranked as the 13th best player and number two shooting guard prospect for college basketball. He then attended Duke University, becoming a noticeable force during his freshman year, helping the team win the ACC Tournament championship game. He also played during the NCAA tournament but had difficulty against the Kansas Jayhawks. In the 2004 to 2005 season he became the ACC Player of the Year thanks to his performances; during his time in the league he held the record for most consecutive free throw shots at 54 and was even set to become the all-time leading free throw shooter. He also broke the NCAA record for three-pointers made, and became the all-time leading scorer in the history of Duke. Because of his performances, he received praise from Duke fans, but hate from opposing schools. During his junior year he became co-captain and in his senior year became the captain of the team.</p><p>He joined the 2006 NBA draft and was selected as the 11th pick overall by the Orlando Magic. Scouting reports about him were mixed, and he became a backup shooting guard for <a href=#>Grant Hill</a>. His play time increased after an injury to Hill and he started to show good performances. He still struggled to get playing time with the team, and in 2008 he requested a trade. Eventually he was given more playing time, and began showing his skills at scoring. This peaked in 2010 when he scored 23 points with eight assists and seven rebounds in one game. Before the 2010 to 2011 season, the Magic resigned him and he continued to play achieving a career high 31 points during one game in 2012.</p><p>In 2013, Redick was traded to the Milwaukee Bucks and was then traded to the Los Angeles Clippers in a subsequent three way trade. He signed a four-year $27 million contract that significantly boosted his net worth. He then really became an offensive force as part of the Clippers, scoring a career high 33 points against the Dallas Mavericks in 2014. This was broken in January 2016 when he scored 40 points against the Houston Rockets.</p><p>In his international career, J.J. was in the 2003 USA Men’s Junior World Championship Team, and in 2005 in the Under-21 Team which won the gold medal at the Global Games and the World Championships.</p><p>For his personal life, it is known that Redick married long-time girlfriend Chelsea Kilgore during 2010. His nickname came from his twin sisters, who repeated his original nickname “J”. He’s also a Christian, having some Bible verses tattooed on his body.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=28.250415973378><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>J. J.
