He said, “It took a pandemic to get me to join twitter! Stay tuned.” Since then, he has been sharing his wisdom and compassion with his followers, covering topics such as stress management, mental health, relationships, and coping with uncertainty. He has also quoted famous psychologist Abraham Maslow by writing:</p><p>“When people appear to be something other than good and decent, it is only because they are reacting to stress, pain, or the deprivation of basic human needs such as security, love, and self-esteem.”</p><p>One of the topics that Dr. Paradise frequently addresses on his Twitter account is the impact of the pandemic on our mental health and well-being. He believes that we are collectively taking dramatic steps to protect the most at-risk, but these intense adaptations make us feel individually vulnerable even as we shelter in place, informed, prepared, and safe at home. He advises us to resist the urge towards information overload, and to consciously choose to disconnect from sources of information that are more provocative than helpful. He also reminds us that adequate sleep, proper nutrition, and regular exercise are more important than ever, as they help us cope with stress and anxiety. He warns us against the use of alcohol and other forms of numbing, which tend to make stress worse long term. He encourages us to take breaks, but also to avoid prolonged periods of inactivity, which can drain our mental health. He suggests that we start a project, learn a new skill, or just complete long overdue tasks, to bolster our sense of agency, which is in especially short supply right now. He acknowledges that uncertainty feels threatening, and that while anticipatory anxiety may initially mobilize us to make protective change, left unchecked, it diminishes our capacity for well-being. He recommends an exercise as simple as three minutes of calm, focused breath, to reset our nervous system.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>Another topic that Dr. Paradise explores on his Twitter account is the effect of the pandemic on our relationships. He observes that our response to COVID-19 amplifies the good and bad in our connections. He says that healthy relationships are strengthened by the pulling inwards, but for families, and especially couples on the brink, the pandemic has stretched fragile bonds past their limit. He uses the hashtag #CovidDivorce to highlight the rising trend of marital breakdowns and separations due to the pandemic. He offers his support and guidance to those who are going through this difficult process, and invites them to join his podcast, DeCoupling: Group Therapy with Dr. Paradise.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Matthew Paradise Age & Height</h2><p>Matthew was born on April 17, 1969, in the USA, making him 54 years old. His exact height is unknown, but he is not a tall man. However, he does not let his height bother him. Instead, he uses humor and positivity to deal with the challenges he faces. He once joked on Reddit that he is “travel size” and that people are relieved when they see him on airplanes. He also said that his size was an advantage as a wrestler in school and that it makes him more accessible to his clients. He added that he has a special appreciation for people who are perceived as physically different. This shows his unique perspective on body image and physical diversity.</p><p>A website called Disractify wrote an article about his height on February 17, 2022. The article was titled “How Tall Is Dr. Paradise on ‘My 600-lb Life’? The Therapist Admits He’s ‘Travel Size.’” The article did not reveal his height, but it quoted his Reddit comment. The article was one of the interesting pieces that discussed his height and his work.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Relationship of Matthew Paradise</h2><p>Matthew Paradise has not revealed much information about his personal life or his romantic partner. He may be married or dating someone, but he has not confirmed or denied it publicly. He may prefer to keep his relationship private, or he may not have one at the moment. Off scarce information available about his family member, Dr. Paradise has siblings and he is related to Julianne L Paradise and Melvin James Henderson.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Net Worth of Matthew Paradise</h2><p>Matthew Paradise’s net worth is estimated to be around $1 million as of 2024.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Dr. Matthew Paradise Quotes</h2><p>“We are collectively taking dramatic steps to protect the most at-risk. Because our behavior shapes our thoughts and feelings, these intense adaptations make us feel individually vulnerable even as we shelter in place, informed, prepared, and safe at home.”</p><p>“Resist the urge towards information overload. The internet and social media may seem to be the only way to stay informed and in touch right now, but a mindful person consciously choses to disconnect from sources of information that are more provocative than helpful.”</p><p>“Adequate sleep, proper nutrition, and regular exercise are more important than ever. Workouts are beneficial because our bodies receive physical activity as a natural remedy for stress (fight or flight). Alcohol and other forms of numbing tend to make stress worse long term.”</p><p>“Breaks are great, but prolonged periods of inactivity are a reliable drain on our mental health. Starting a project, learning a new skill, or just completing long overdue tasks will bolster our sense of agency, which is in especially short supply right now.”</p><p>“Uncertainty feels threatening. While anticipatory anxiety may initially mobilize us to make protective change, left unchecked, it diminishes our capacity for well-being.
