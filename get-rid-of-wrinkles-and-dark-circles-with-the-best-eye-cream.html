Or have you had enough of your under-eye wrinkles? Maybe you don’t have wrinkles yet but still want to take preventative care of your skin now so you will remain wrinkle-free in the future. No matter what your situation, It is always smart to use an eye cream to keep the delicate skin around your eyes soft and supple. Because the skin underneath your eyes is extremely thin and fragile, it is very susceptible to wrinkles and dryness. The best way to care for and protect this delicate skin is with an eye cream.</p><p>Furthermore, it is important to use a high-quality eye cream in order to reap the most benefits. Some eye creams are made using poor ingredients that may even irritate your skin. Or, they may be formulated with cheap ingredients that don’t work. For these reasons, you should be sure to only use good quality eye creams with safe, effective ingredients in order to really see results. We’ve compiled a list of the top eye creams of 2024 so you can have smooth, healthy under eyes.</p>Show Contents<p class=review-toc__subtitle>Comparing the Top Eye Creams of 2024 in Detail</p><ul class=review-toc__list><li class="review-toc__list-item table-of-contents__list-item"><a href=#>CeraVe Cream</a></li><li class="review-toc__list-item table-of-contents__list-item"><a href=#>Hanalei Cream</a></li><li class="review-toc__list-item table-of-contents__list-item"><a href=#>LilyAna Cream</a></li><li class="review-toc__list-item table-of-contents__list-item"><a href=#>RoC Cream</a></li><li class="review-toc__list-item table-of-contents__list-item"><a href=#>Neutrogena Hydro Boost Cream</a></li><li class="review-toc__list-item table-of-contents__list-item"><a href=#>Cetaphil Cream</a></li></ul><h2 class=review-subtitle>Comparing the Top Eye Creams of 2024 in Detail</h2><h3 class=review-product__title><a href=# rel=nofollow>CeraVe Cream</a> <span class=review-product__title-badge>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Best Overall</span></h3><a href=# rel=nofollow><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/CeraVe-hollywoodlife.jpg></a><h4 class=review-product__features-title>Key Features</h4><ul><li style=font-weight:400>This product is ophthalmologist tested as safe to use on the skin underneath and around the eye</li><li style=font-weight:400>This formula can be used both day and night</li><li style=font-weight:400>It has a light-weight texture that absorbs into your skin easily</li><li style=font-weight:400>This product is fragrance-free, hypoallergenic, and non-comedogenic; it will not clog pores</li><li style=font-weight:400>It is developed by dermatologists and is clinically tested as safe for use</li></ul><p>The active ingredients in this product are ceramides, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid.

Why? The skin around your eyes is very delicate and quite different from the skin on the rest of your face. Hence, this particular area of your face requires special skincare.</p><p>The sensitive nature of the skin around your eyes makes it extra prone to irritation from pollution, the sun’s rays, and chemical irritants in makeup and <a href=#>moisturizers</a>. You need an eye cream specially formulated with anti-aging and hydrating properties to help combat these unwanted skin problems. Aside from reducing signs of skin aging, a good cream for the eyes helps to brighten discoloration, reduces under-eye puffiness, and smooth fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p>For help choosing the right products for your skin, we have prepared this buying guide so that you can be confident you are purchasing a safe, high-quality, and effective eye cream.</p><h3>Why Do I Need an Eye Cream?</h3><p>The skin around your eye has small muscles and is considerably thinner than other parts of your body. It is very sensitive and prone to several issues such as fine lines, crow’s feet, puffiness, wrinkles, and discoloration. Using an eye cream can both diminish and prevent the following effects:</p><h4>Dark circles</h4><p>Dark circles are instances of discoloration around the eye area and can be caused by many different things, including sun exposure, hyperpigmentation, heredity, stress, or smoking. If you are prone to dark circles, then you know how frustrating it is to look in the mirror and see your dark circles staring back at you, making you look tired and worn-out.</p><p>You need an eye cream to brighten these dark circles. When buying an eye cream, look for products that contain brightening agents like licorice, kojic acid, vitamin C, and vitamin K. These ingredients will brighten dark areas in no time.</p><h4>Puffiness</h4><p>Under-eye puffiness is mainly caused by a buildup of fluid underneath the thin under-eye tissue. You may notice your under-eye area is especially puffy when you wake up in the morning from a very deep sleep.</p><p>Puffiness can be triggered by many factors, including sleep deprivation, diet, alcohol, or old age. Puffy under eyes can also be a result of health-related problems such as allergies or sinus issues.</p><p>If you have puffy eyes, then you need an eye cream to help combat the swelling. Look out for eye products that contain ingredients like cucumber or caffeine. These ingredients have been known to reduce swelling.</p><h4>Fine lines and wrinkles</h4><p>Our constant muscle actions such as frowning, smiling, winking, and blinking can easily cause the thin skin underneath the eye to wrinkle. This is why the under-eye area is usually one of the first to show signs of aging.</p><p>If you have fine lines or wrinkles, look for an eye cream with collagen-building ingredients such as retinol. This active ingredient helps to boost thinning and aging skin and smooth fine lines.</p><h3>What Should I Look Out for When Choosing the Top Eye Cream?</h3><h4>Hyaluronic acid</h4><p>Hyaluronic acid is found naturally in the skin. Hyaluronic acid helps in drawing in water which helps to plump and hydrate the skin for up to 24 hours. Under-eye problems such as wrinkles and fine lines are caused by skin dryness, which is easily combated with hyaluronic acid.</p><p>If lack of hydration is the culprit behind your skin problems, then you may want to consider getting an eye repair cream that contains hyaluronic acid.</p><h4>Retinol</h4><p>Retinol is an essential ingredient in <a href=#>skincare products</a> because it stimulates collagen production and reduces the sign of aging.</p><p>The skin underneath and around the eyes is very sensitive, and retinol is harsh on the skin when too much is applied. So we recommend that you buy eye repair creams or gels that have a low concentration of retinol.</p><h4>Antioxidants</h4><p>The rays from the sun and other environmental pollutants may stress your skin and increase the chances of getting fine lines and wrinkles.</p><p>When buying the best eye repair cream, look out for antioxidants such as Vitamins C, E, and K, berry extracts, and botanical extracts. These natural ingredients are some of the best for keeping skin looking healthy and youthful.</p><p>Vitamin C is an antioxidant that protects you from the rays of the sun and brightens dark circles on your skin. Vitamin E soothes and moisturizes the skin, while Vitamin K improves the circulation of blood, and reduces swelling and dark circles in the process.</p><h4>Ceramides, peptides, and niacinamide</h4><p>Ceramides are active agents that improve the strength and moisture of the skin. They are suitable for thinning skin that is prone to fine lines, wrinkles, and crow's feet.</p><p>Peptides are compounds that support collagen production in the skin. They are suitable for sensitive, dry and thinning skin.</p><p>Niacinamides are antioxidants that help to reduce excess sebum in the skin. They also have a hydrating and brightening effect, leaving your skin looking plump and well moisturized.</p><h3>What Is the Best Way To Apply Eye Cream?</h3><p>When applying your eye cream, put a small amount onto your finger and gently tab underneath your eye, and on the skin along the sides of your eye as well.</p><p>An eye cream can also be applied underneath your eyebrow, but be careful not to apply it on your upper eyelids (unless the product specifically says that you can).</p><h2 class=review-faqs__title>People Also Asked</h2>How long does eye cream take to work?<p>This depends on the active ingredients contained in the formula and the skin issue you're looking to fix. Some eye creams take just a couple of weeks to start producing results, while others may take up to a month or two.</p>How often should I apply eye cream?<p>Apply eye cream twice daily. This ensures that the hydrating properties and active ingredients get a chance to work properly on your skin. A morning and night application is best.</p>How much does an eye cream cost?<p>The price of an eye cream depends on the ingredients used in the formula. An average eye cream costs between $10-$30. Others may cost between $35-$100.</p><img width=64 height=64 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/HL_social.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <a href=# title="Posts by HollywoodLife Reviews" class="author url fn" rel=author>HollywoodLife Reviews</a> HollywoodLife For over a decade Hollywood Life has been a leading source of celebrity, entertainment, and pop culture news.
