He revealed during an exclusive interview with <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/food/pat-neely-speaks-out-divorce-gina-neely/>People Magazine</a> that he never agreed to any interviews about his separation since he never knew how to explain it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/403a45be186fd9c72a9c43377ebca9dc11038651540483032.jpeg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg>“At the time, I was hurting.

Last March, the former Mrs. Neely revealed that although they seemed to be happy, bubbly, and affectionate in their TV show, it wasn't like that at all in real life.</p><p class=Fg>While their relationship had to end, Pat chooses to focus on their better memories, including filming 11 seasons of one of the most top-rated shows at one point.</p><p class=Fg>“One of the things that I’ll always cherish about Down Home with the Neelys was that I had an opportunity to get on television every day and invite people into our home. And I was able to share that with my high school sweetheart, a woman I truly loved, and to be me. I never had to act.”</p><p class=Fg>Although his wish of growing old with Gina didn't happen, he accepted Gina's request to separate. The couple shared two children, Shelbi, 23, and Spenser, 29.</p><p class=Fg>Now, Neely has since moved on and is married to Tamika Parks and he claims it was "love at first sight".</p><p class=Fg>The two co-parent Tamika's 5-year-old son from another relationship, and their daughter, Eriel, 3 months.</p><p class=Fg>While he kept his relationship under wraps in the past few years, he is now ready to share his beautiful family to the world, especially since he is set to head back to work next year as a culinary consultant for an Atlanta-based franchise called "This Is It!
