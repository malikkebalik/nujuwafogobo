However, not many people know that her late patents fueled her determination for success. In a rare <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.facebook.com/TheSourceMagazine/photos/a.478030730075/10161543967545076>image</a>, a young Megan Thee Stallion and her mother were pictured together.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Megan Thee Stallion's Parents Were Her Support</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Pete's father passed away before witnessing his daughter's rise to fame, and her mother later on. However, Pete's parents heavily impacted her career as a musician; her father was what she <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.distractify.com/p/megan-thee-stallion-parents>called </a>"a full-time hustler" and instilled confidence in her and a strong understanding of what to accept from people.</p><p class=dh>Pete started <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.distractify.com/p/megan-thee-stallion-parents>writing her lyrics and performing</a> her raps at sixteen; various videos of her freestyling and partaking in rap battles went viral on the internet. After she graduated from Pearland High School in 2013, she began performing under her childhood nickname, The Stallion.</p><p class=dh>Over the years, Pete climbed the charts and worked with artists from Dua Lipa to Doja Cat. After spending years climbing the charts, she worked on her latest highly anticipated album, "Traumazine," and managed to <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.thecut.com./article/megan-thee-stallion-traumazine-profile.html>graduate </a>from Texas Southern University with a bachelor's degree in health administration.</p><p class=dh>She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://twitter.com/popsugar/status/1564324768249167873?s=21&t=PPhTYI3vNI8UMfdEq3NBnw">said </a>she had the "coolest parents in the world" growing up and tried to strike a balance in being a mix of them both - and she was getting the hang of it. She and her mother had a good cop/ bad cop relationship, but after her mother's passing, Pete <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/megan-thee-stallion-parents-the-cut-quotes-48932585>said</a>:</p><p class=dh>"But now I don't have the luxury of having somebody who could be my bad cop. Now I have to be both."</p><p class=dh>Her father had high hopes that she would be somebody someday, under the impression that she would pursue a career as a model; she initially<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.popsugar.co.uk/celebrity/megan-thee-stallion-parents-the-cut-quotes-48932585> hid her dreams</a> of becoming a rapper from her parents, afraid they might disapprove.</p><p class=dh>After the loss of her parents, all she wanted to do was make them proud. It kept her inspired, always finding ways to impress her parents, even in their absence.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Megan's Mom Was Also a Rapper</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Pete's musical gift seemingly ran in the family; her mother, Holly Thomas, was also a rapper and went by the stage name Holly-Wood. She was the first female rapper Pete knew.</p><p class=dh>Pete spent her time studying her mother and going on trips with her to recording studios; Thomas's musical career lasted from 2001 to 2007; she released music and even tried to start a record label.</p><p class=dh>She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.vulture.com/2019/04/megan-thee-stallion-profile-big-ole-freak.html>described </a>her mother's music as "rougher" and "more gangster" than her own; when her mother heard her daughter's music for the first time, she was taken aback by Pete's explicit lyrics.</p><p class=dh>When Thomas noticed Pete was serious about pursuing a career as a rapper, she began managing her daughter while she was in college.</p><p class=dh>Thomas <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/1213006/megan-thee-stallion-parents-tory-lanez-shot-party/>passed away</a> in March 2019 after a battle with brain cancer; her mother's passing left Pete devastated; she found herself in a position where she felt like she couldn't trust anybody.</p><p class=dh>She <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/megan-thee-stallion-mom/>said </a>her mother was "driving the car" during the early stages of her career, and she didn't have to think about much - her mother handled everything and supported her.</p><p class=dh>Without her mother telling her she did a good job or offering Pete her opinion – which she trusted, Pete felt she had nobody to turn to and whom she could confide.</p><p class=dh>Pete revealed that her mother told her not to stop chasing her dreams, even after her health worsened. "I took that literally," Pete <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/megan-thee-stallion-mom/>said</a>.

She wrote the song as a diary entry dedicated to herself and her late mother; she chose to try something new and turned it into a song.</p><p class=dh>Her mother was not only the inspiration behind her music but also her motivation to finish her degree. Pete made her mother proud when she walked across the stage to fetch her degree but <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/music/megan-thee-stallion-pursue-degree-make-late-mom-proud/>admitted </a>it was not just for her but all the women in her life that made her who she was.</p><p class=dh>On days when her grief was a little more difficult, Pete would <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/megan-thee-stallion-posts-sweet-tribute-to-her-fallen-mother-i-miss-my-mama-news.93349.html>share </a>how much she missed her mother on her social media. In a <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/theestallion/status/1562269873903910912>tweet</a>, she also defended the hard work that went into her career and expressed her frustrations with people who tried to devalue her and her mother's efforts.</p><p><h2 class=hh><strong class=bh>Megan Thee Stallion's Father Died When She Was 15</strong></h2></p><p class=dh>Pete's father spent the first eight years of his daughter's life <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a31932416/megan-thee-stallion-interview-2020/>behind bars</a> before he died while she was in her freshman year in high school.</p><p class=dh>Upon his release, it was like no time had passed, and they spent all their time together.
