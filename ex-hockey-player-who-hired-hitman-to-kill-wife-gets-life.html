The judge also sentenced him to 25 years to life on a second-degree murder charge.</p><p>Reading a statement out loud in court, Thomas was adamant that he was innocent —&nbsp;as he thanked Kelley’s family for caring for his two kids “until I get them back.”</p><p>“There are two families that lost something in this tragedy. My children lost their mother and were ripped away from their father,” he said. “I’m sorry Kelley is dead. I’m sorry that I can’t see my kids. I had absolutely nothing to do with the death of Kelley, absolutely.”</p><p>His and Kelley’s 8-year-old daughter, Charlie, wrote a letter to the court which was read aloud.</p><p>“I feel my dad is a coward because he asked Michael Beard to kill my mom,” the little girl wrote.</p><p>Family members said Charlie suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder while her younger brother Cullen, who was just 3 when his mom was murdered, calls out for her at night.</p><p>Defense attorney Ray Schlather’s eleventh-hour bid to get Thomas’ conviction tossed — arguing that a polygraph test showed he was telling the truth about not being responsible for Kelley’s death — was denied Monday.</p><p>“Tom Clayton did not kill his wife, was not responsible for the death of his wife,” Schlather said. “I’ve been doing this 40 years. I have the utmost faith in the jury system. This is one time the jury got it wrong.”</p><p>Beard, meanwhile, is serving a life without parole sentence after he was convicted on the same charges.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlfnh7j21ma25fmsVutM6cop6xXaW5osXEq2SwoJ9itaq%2BxJ1koaGkoq6vedOoZKShnKF6uLXFnmSgnaSoeq21xZ5m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jayden-dae-shun-munson-and-jaylan-marray-jackson-death-two-unfortunate-victims-in-the-bloody-shoo.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jayden DaeShun Munson and Jaylan Marray Jackson Death: Two unfortunate victims in the bloody shoo</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cristiano-ronaldo-s-brother-being-investigated-for-fraud.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cristiano Ronaldo's brother being investigated for fraud</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
