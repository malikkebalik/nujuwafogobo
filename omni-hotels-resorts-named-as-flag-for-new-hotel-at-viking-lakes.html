"The company's expansion into <span class=xn-location>Minnesota</span> is a testament to this market and to the overall vision of developing Viking Lakes into a first-class destination."</p><p>"Omni Hotels & Resorts is growing at a rapid pace over the next few years and our expansion into <span class=xn-location>Minnesota</span> with Omni Viking Lakes Hotel is an important next step in the strategic development of our brand," said <span class=xn-person>Peter Strebel</span>, president of Omni Hotels & Resorts. "This project will be a true collaboration that reflects the American Nordic local color offering travelers a one-of-a-kind experience."</p><p><b>Design & DÃ©cor<br></b>The hotel design, led by ESG Architecture & Design, draws upon Nordic architectural traditions and features elements inspired by the American Nordic landscapes of the North and the dynamic and unpredictable character of its climate and seasons. Awe-inspiring occurrences, such as the northern lights, combined with feelings of comfort, well-being and refuge inspire many of the forms, finishes and features within the hotel. Clean lines, neutral color palettes and simple, but deliberate design elements will be showcased throughout the guest rooms and public spaces.&nbsp;</p><p>"Omni is known for incorporating local flavor and color from each destination into our hotels," said <span class=xn-person>Laura McKoy</span>, creative director + vice president of interior design of Omni Hotels & Resorts.
