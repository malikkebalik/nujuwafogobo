Unfortunately, life had other plans for the stillborn daughter of rapper T.I. and his wife, Tameka Cottle. The death of the celebrity couple’s child broke the artists’ hearts, but it also brought them closer together. It’s been more than a decade since Leyah’s stillbirth, but her parents’ hearts are still filled with her fleeting memories.</h3><h2>Who exactly is Leyah Amore Harris?</h2><p>Tameka Cottle and her Grammy-winning rapper husband, T.I., had a stillbirth child, Leyah Amore Harris. Leyah’s parents were so excited about the pregnancy and the birth of their daughter that they had already decided on a name for her.</p><p>Cottle, a former member of the popular R&B group Xscape, discovered she was pregnant with her second child with husband T.I. in late 2006. But it wasn’t long after the world had stolen all of her happiness that she learned the tragic news from her doctor.</p><p>Tameka was warned to be cautious after a check-up revealed that her baby was sandwiched between two split sacs. In fact, the child was thought to have a high chance of being entangled by the umbilical cord inside the womb. However, she was assured that everything was in order.</p><p>The singer, on the other hand, had no idea she would soon be losing her baby.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Leyah-Amore-Harris-206x300.jpg><h2>The Untimely Death of Leyah Amore Harris</h2><p>Unfortunately, Tameka and her rapper husband went to the hospital the next day and were told by the specialist that her baby had no heartbeat. Devastated by the news, the poor mother was forced to deliver her baby stillborn at the age of six months.</p><p>After her child was born, the couple was visited by everyone and given privacy to have their last, which was also their first moment with their stillborn daughter. Leyah was dressed, wrapped in a blanket, and placed in a basket.</p><p>Leyah was buried shortly after, with a funeral service organized by her family. Tameka, on the other hand, keeps her belongings, including flowers and pictures from her gravestone, close by. The singer, on the other hand, rarely visits her gravesite in order to avoid painful memories.</p><h2>Leyah Armore Harris’s Siblings</h2><p>The following year, Tameka and T.I. welcomed another child, a son named Major Philant Harris. The couple also has a son, Clifford Joseph Harris III, born in 2004, and a daughter, Heiress Diana Harris, born in 2016.</p><p>Leyah’s mother also has a daughter with her previous husband, Zonnie Pullins, named Zonnique Pullins. Similarly, T.I. has children from previous relationships.</p><p>The rapper is the father of Domani Harris and Messiah Ya’Majesty Harris, whom he shares with former partner Lashon Dixon, as well as another daughter, Deyjah Imani Harris, who he shares with Ms. Niko.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/popularnetworth.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Leyah-Amore-Harris-300x300.png><h2>Fast Facts: Leyah Amore Harris</h2><ul><li>T.I. and Tameka Cottle’s stillborn daughter is Leyah Armore Harris.</li><li>Leyah was born in the sixth month of her mother’s pregnancy.</li><li>She was sandwiched between two separated sacs and had no heartbeat.</li><li>If both of her parents were still alive, she would have a total of seven siblings.</li><li>Leyah was born on March 22, 2007.</li></ul><h2>Quick facts:</h2><table id=factsDetails class="highlight sticky"><tbody><tr><th><span class="heading dateOfBirth" style=font-weight:400>Date of Birth :</span></th><td><span class=value><a href=# rel=nofollow>March 22&nbsp;</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow>2007</a></span></td></tr><tr><th><span class="heading age" style=font-weight:400>Age :</span></th><td><span class=value>14 years old</span></td></tr><tr><th><span class="heading familyName" style=font-weight:400>Family Name :</span></th><td><span class=value>Amore</span></td></tr><tr><th><span class="heading birthPlace" style=font-weight:400>Birth Country :</span></th><td><a title="United States" href=# rel="follow nofollow"><span style=color:#333>United States</span></a></td></tr><tr><th><span class="heading birthSign" style=font-weight:400>Birth Sign :</span></th><td><span class=value><a href=# rel=nofollow>Pisces</a></span></td></tr></tbody></table><p>You may also like: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Avery Elizabeth Leeb</a>, <a href=# rel=bookmark>Kayden Gaulden</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmion6XCra3Rp5ytr5%2Bnwal6wqikaKSVrq6pecCmpqudXZ2us77IrGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./madchen-amick-s-wiki-bio-age-height-children-married-net-worth-husband.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Madchen Amick's Wiki, Bio, Age, Height, Children, Married, Net Worth, Husband!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kodie-shane-bio-reveals-openly-lesbian-rapper-is-happily-dating-her-girlfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kodie Shane Bio Reveals: Openly Lesbian Rapper Is Happily Dating Her Girlfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
