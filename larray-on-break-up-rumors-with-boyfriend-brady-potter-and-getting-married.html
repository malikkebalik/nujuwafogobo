He is one of the&nbsp;most recent members to join.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Coming to his personal life, Larray, who is openly gay, has been in a relationship with fellow social media star&nbsp;Brady Potter. According to Popbuzz, the two have been together since April 2019. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The 23-year-old was once romantically linked to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>James Charles</a> after taking&nbsp;part in the 'Couples Only Challenge' on TikTok. But both of them never confirmed that they were dating. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><h2>Larray and Brady Potter’s Break Up Rumor</h2><p>The internet has lately been stuffed with rumors of&nbsp;Larray and&nbsp;Potter's&nbsp;breakup. In the wake of that, when&nbsp;Larray posted a tweet on Sunday, September 5, writing "broken," many were quick to believe that the rumors were actually true.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>But there is a twist. The since-deleted tweet was later posted by @tiktokinsiders on Instagram, stating Larray and&nbsp;Potter had a feud, and the former had unfollowed his boyfriend on social media. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Sometime after the post was made,&nbsp;Larray dropped a comment on that post. He clarified that his tweet had nothing to do with&nbsp;his relationship with&nbsp;Potter.</p><p>"He [Potter] deserves the world, promise you that he would never hurt me," he added. The California native also wrote another comment in the same post and revealed his tweet about his missing cat.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p><strong>Larray addresses his breakup rumors with boyfriend Brady Potter.</strong> (Photo: TikTok Insiders'&nbsp;Instagram)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Both of his comments soon received hundreds of likes and numerous supportive messages from the couple's fans. Fans were also happy to know that&nbsp;Larray and&nbsp;Potter were still together and hadn't broken up.</p><h2>Larray Talks about Getting Married</h2><p>In early September, the YouTuber sat down with <a href=# rel=follow>He's All That</a> actress&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Addison Rae</a> for a podcast conversation, where he talked about his relationship with&nbsp;Potter and addressed the question of if the couple was going to get married soon. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>He shared that he and his boyfriend had been together in a relationship for the last three years while&nbsp;jokingly adding he would be happily dropping his hands in front of&nbsp;Potter.</p><p>But on a serious note, he revealed he hadn't thought of getting married so far.</p><p>Instead,&nbsp;Larray humorously claimed that&nbsp;Rae would be the one to get married first, saying,&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>Speaking of marriage, we're getting so old first of all, we're growing so fast.&nbsp;Let's talk about the fact that one of us is gonna get married first and I feel like it's gonna be you because it's not gonna be me.</p><p>Later during the conversation, when the actress asked him how many kids would he love to have, he said that he wanted four kids in total:&nbsp;two kids of his own and two kids from his husband. In addition, he also showed a willingness to adopt some children.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKSRp7%2BixYybqZqcqWK9sMDTnqlmmqKarqx51KlloaydoQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./lee-norris.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Lee Norris</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jerry-rice-net-worth-newsnow-nigeria.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jerry Rice Net Worth - NewsNow Nigeria</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
