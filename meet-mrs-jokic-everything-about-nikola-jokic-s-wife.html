Since the player has kept his personal life out of the spotlight, very little is known about his wife.</p><p>Similar to her husband, Macesic is also very private about her personal life. Her Instagram account is set to private and the few updates about their life together come from Jokic’s rare posts about things outside the court.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Jokic and Macesic&nbsp;have a lot in common.

There, Jokic and his partner can be seen singing and dancing. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Jokic and Macesic welcomed their first and only child together, daughter Ognjena Jokic, in September 2021.</p><p>Miroslav Cuk <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">broke the news</a> via a tweet. “Welcome to the world, Ognjena Jokic!

Nejanja is a former Division I player who previously played at the University of Detroit Mercy.</p><p>Similarly, Strahinja is also a former basketball player. He has experience playing in Europe.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>When speaking about Strahinja, Jokic said his brother wasn’t “that talented” but had a very competitive spirit.</p><p>In a previous interview, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Jokic shared</a> he was teaching Macesic to play cards with his brothers.</p><p>He added he was getting her to cheat since it was the only way to win against Nemanja and Strahinja, who also cheated all the time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaKaZoLytrYyjpqShk2LEqrLEZ5%2BtpZw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./michigan-marc-keast-prosecutor-wikipedia-everything-on-his-family.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Michigan: Marc Keast Prosecutor Wikipedia -Everything On His Family</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./lada-st-edmund.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Lada St. Edmund</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
