Ellen DeGeneres' mother, Betty, was there to support her, standing by her every step of the way both on and off the screen.</p><p class=dh>The big reveal later led to the start of a new movement by Betty, who was admittedly torn between passive acceptance and embracing her daughter's sexuality. She chose the latter, attracting <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.thelavendereffect.org/projects/ohp/betty-degeneres/>several criticisms from the public.</a></p><p class=dh>Betty DeGeneres eventually joined PFLAG (the United States' first and largest organization uniting parents, families, and allies with people who are lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) marking her first step to<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.thelavendereffect.org/projects/ohp/betty-degeneres/> becoming a gay rights advocate</a>.</p><p class=dh>Shortly after proving herself a passionate activist in PFLAG, the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) enlisted her as a spokesperson for the National Coming Out Day.</p><p class=dh>The mandate made Betty the first straight spokesperson for HRC's National Coming Out Day.

Some of these situations were life-threatening, but Betty DeGeneres, in her usual bravery, overcame them. Topping the list was the activist's battle with cancer in the '70s.</p><p class=dh>While married to her second husband, Gruessendorf, Betty received her breast cancer diagnosis. After enduring daunting treatments, including a mastectomy, the gay rights advocate <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/ellen-degeneres-helped-mom-with-cancer-fight/>won the battle against breast cancer.</a></p><p class=dh>However, the victory came at the cost of her marriage. The time she spent convalescing admittedly helped strengthen her bond with daughter, <a class="me a" href=#>Ellen DeGeneres,</a> who was sixteen at the time. Speaking on her relationship with Ellen, Betty <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/ellen-degeneres-helped-mom-with-cancer-fight/>once divulged:</a></p><p class=dh>"It's a very special relationship that I do not take for granted. We've been there for each other."</p><p class=dh>Years after seeing her mom through her cancer battle, Ellen noticed a lump in her breast. The TV host underwent a surgical session early to remove the lump, which was considered non-cancerous.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>ELLEN DEGENERES' FATHER</strong></p><p class=dh>Betty's first husband, Elliot DeGeneres, stayed married to her for twenty-two years before their divorce. Together, the pair are parents to Ellen and her brother, Vance DeGeneres.</p><p class=dh>Elliot lived in New Orleans, Louisiana, and spent his life as a self-proclaimed Christian scientist. Remarkably, he never believed in medicines or hospitals, yet, lived a long, purposeful life.</p><p class=dh><strong class=bh>MEET VANCE DEGENERES</strong></p><p class=dh>Like his mom and sister, Ellen's brother, Vance DeGeneres,<a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/who-is-vance-degeneres-ellen-degeneres-brother-and-how-close-are-they.html/> built a career in the spotlights. </a>The 65-year-old grew up in New Orleans, where he remained even after his parent's divorce.</p><p class=dh>In the 1970s, Vance hosted a radio show, "New Waves, New Orleans," after spending two years in the Marine Corps. The former Marine corporal went on to become an actor, a comedian and a musician, having starred in movies like "The Rat," and "Mr. Bill Goes To Washington."</p><p class=dh>Ellen's brother has been married to headshot photographer, Joanna Brooks DeGeneres, since 2013.
