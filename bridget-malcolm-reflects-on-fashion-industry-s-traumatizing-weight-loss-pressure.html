Malcolm made many shocking revelations and spoke at length about her time at Victoria's Secret.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>The former Victoria's Secret star has turned away from commercial modeling and is now a "mental health advocate."&nbsp;She co-hosts a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">podcast</a>&nbsp;alongside Dr. Allie Sharma called Model Mentality that aims to open up the conversation around mental health, "one coversation at a time." <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>More surprisingly, Malcolm is also currently a communications intern in the&nbsp;United Nations and co-founder of a support group that aims to help models struggling with mental health issues. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-613 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>Breaking from a Haunting Career</h2><p>Malcolm, now 29, started modeling when she was 16. Although she stopped modeling three years ago, she is finally speaking out about her traumatic experiences&nbsp;after batting and overcoming severe PTSD.&nbsp;</p><p>Malcolm revealed that by the time she was 18, she had been "sexually assulted several times," and "groomed by a much older man."&nbsp;She stated that her agency wanted her to use cocaine and "have a lot of sex" to lose weight.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>She needed alcohol in order to socialize and became dependent on Xanax and Ambien. Following this, Malcolm even become depressed and battled through years of unhealthy weight loss, going through bouts of anorexia and orthorexia. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Malcolm&nbsp;reached a breaking point when she turned 26, having a nervous breakdown on her birthday. She faced "suiciadal ideation" and could not leave her house for an entire year as it would often result in panic attacks.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h2>Bridget Malcolm's&nbsp;Time at Victoria's Secret</h2><p>Though Malcolm appeared on two shows for Victoria's Secret and had a successful career, the model was firmly against industry practices. In a TikTok video post which is now viral, she&nbsp;tries on her bra from the 2016 Victoria’s Secret fashion show. "Its a size 30A. I am now a size 34B, which is healthy for me.” The bra was clearly too small for her and looked wholly uncomfortable. She exclaimed, "Victoria’s Secret your performative ally-ship is a joke.”</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>The Australian model also exposed former CEO Ed Rezek, who she claims body-shamed her and rejected her for the fashion show back in 2017.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><h2>The New and Improved Malcolm</h2><p>While Malcolm's past speaks to the dark and unrealistic demands of the fashion industry, she has worked hard to build a life outside of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Her&nbsp;website Bridget Malcolm&nbsp;highlights the person she has become today. Also a writer on Harper's Bazaar, Malcolm has written&nbsp;extensively on various topics, including body-positivity, fitness, and nutrition.&nbsp;She advocates a holistic approach to health and wellness and encourages people to reach out to her and seek help in any&nbsp;of these avenues.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Her Instagram highlights also include a fascinating section of books&nbsp;the former model has read over the past years. Her collection includes classics such as Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eyes and Fyodor Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>While she is clearly more focused on mental health, she still isn't afraid to show her bikini body at the&nbsp;beach.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinaJqinrGosdNmpJqkk6S5rnnWnqCgoKShvLS%2FjJupmpuVqHupwMyl</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./glance-at-the-life-of-jim-nantz.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Glance At The Life Of Jim Nantz</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-yulanda-wilkins-everything-you-need-to-know-about-her.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Yulanda Wilkins?
