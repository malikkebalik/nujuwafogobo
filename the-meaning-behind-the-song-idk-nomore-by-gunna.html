Gunna sings, “I don’t know no more, I can’t put my finger on it, I don’t know the code.” These lines convey a feeling of being lost and not fully understanding the world around him. It’s a sentiment that many of us can relate to at times, where we’re trying to make sense of our lives and the choices we have to make.</p><p>Gunna also touches upon the theme of success and how it can change relationships. He mentions that some people were never used to money and don’t know how to handle it. This creates a divide between him and those individuals who may not understand his current lifestyle. Gunna states, “They lookin’ for me, they don’t know I’m buildin’ a wall,” indicating that he’s distancing himself from those who may not have his best interests at heart.</p><p>In the first verse, Gunna addresses the issue of trust. He mentions that some people, even those close to him, have spoken about him in a negative way. It’s a reminder that not everyone is always genuine, and it can be challenging to trust others completely. Gunna emphasizes his ability to stand alone and not rely on others, saying, “I could do it on my own, don’t wanna fuck with niggas.” It’s a testament to his independence and self-reliance.</p><p>The following verse delves deeper into Gunna’s personal experiences. He questions the motives of those around him, expressing his disappointment in people who had ulterior motives. Gunna raps, “Wanna know how Wunna feel? Then listen to my music, talk about that shit and all that knowin’ I was clueless.” This line suggests that Gunna uses his music to express his emotions and experiences, allowing his audience to connect with him on a personal level.</p><p>Overall, “idk nomore” by Gunna is a song that explores themes of uncertainty, success, trust, and personal growth. Gunna’s lyrics and the production create a captivating and introspective experience for listeners. It’s a track that allows us to reflect on our own lives and the relationships we have with others.</p><p>As with any song, the interpretation and meaning can vary from person to person. Everyone may find their own personal connection to the lyrics and the emotions conveyed. For me, this song is currently serving as a soundtrack to my daily activities, whether it’s working, playing games, or simply reflecting on life.
