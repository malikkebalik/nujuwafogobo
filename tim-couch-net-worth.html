He is a retired professional American Football player, who played in the position of quarterback for the Cleveland Browns in the National Football League (NFL). At the present time, he is a sports analyst for Fox Sports South. He is an active member in the sports industry since 1999.</p><p>Have you ever wondered how rich Tim Couch is, as of early 2016? According to authoritative sources, it is estimated that the size of Tim’s net worth is as high as $26 million, earned through his successful career as a professional football player. Another source is coming from his work on TV as a sports analyst.</p><h3>Tim Couch Net Worth $26 Million</h3><p>Tim Couch started playing football while he attended Leslie County High School, and already began to show his skills, setting several national records, including most passes completed (872), and most passing yardage (12,104).</p><p>After matriculation, Tim enrolled at Kentucky University, and played football for the Kentucky Wildcats. In the first seven games, Tim was a second quarterback, splitting time with Billy Jack Haskins, but the Wildcats appoointed a new coach in Hal Mumme, and Tim became starter.</p><p>He left the university in 1999 to enter the NFL Draft, but during his time at the university, Tim also set several records, such as best completion percentage in one game at 83%, for completions per game 36.4%, 4,151 offensive yards in a season, 377.4 offensive yards per game and 4,275 passing yards.</p><p>In the 1999 NFL Draft, Tim was selected as the 1st pick by the Cleveland Browns, however, Tim never lived up to the expectations of the league. He stayed with the Browns until 2003, having ups and down along the way, but injuries hindered him in achieving success, including a broken leg and broken thumb. Nevertheless, he became the Browns` all-time leader in pass completion percentage at 59.8%, and is also in the first ten in the following categories, 7th all-time in touchdown passes, 3rd in completions, 6th in QB rating, and several others.</p><p>After the Cleveland Browns, he found engagement with the Green Bay Packers for the 2004 season, however, he never played due to a rotation calf injury, and eventually underwent surgery, which kept him sidelined for the entire season, and so he was released by the team. He couldn`t find a new team for two years, until in 2007 he signed a contract with the Jacksonville Jaguars, which also added to his net worth, however, after one preseason game, the Jaguars released Tim, and he decided to retire.</p><p>Tim was soon hired as a broadcaster, and he is currently working for Fox Sports South, as analyst of the sports related show SEC Gridiron Live. Furthermore, Tim is also the color analyst of SEC Regional Network football package, which also adds to his overall net worth.</p><p>When it comes to his personal life, Tim Couch has been married since February 2005 to Heather Kozar, who is a model and former Playboy Playmate. The couple has two sons and currently resides in Lexington, Kentucky.</p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿<table readability=1.6578947368421><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Tim Couch</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$26 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>July 31, 1977</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Hyden, Kentucky, USA</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.93&nbsp;m</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>99.8&nbsp;kg</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Football player</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>University of Kentucky</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Heather Kozar (m. 2005)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Chase Scott, Brady Couch</td></tr><tr><td>Siblings</td><td>Greg Couch</td></tr><tr readability=0.37837837837838><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>https://twitter.com/timcouchtv</a></td></tr><tr readability=0.20512820512821><td>IMDB</td><td><a rel=nofollow href=#>http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2325442/</a></td></tr><tr><td>Nominations</td><td>Heisman Trophy</td></tr></table><table class=interesting_facts readability=4.8662551440329><tr><th>#</th><th>Fact</th></tr><tr readability=2><td>1</td><td>Inducted into the University of Kentucky Athletics Hall of Fame in 2005 (inaugural class).</td></tr><tr readability=3.5905511811024><td>2</td><td>Has two sons with wife <a href=#>Heather Kozar</a>-Couch: Chase Scott was born on August 5, 2005 and son Brady Couch was born in March 2009.</td></tr><tr readability=4><td>3</td><td>#1 overall pick in the 1999 NFL draft out of the University of Kentucky.
