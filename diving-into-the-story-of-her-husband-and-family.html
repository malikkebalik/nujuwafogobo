She has worked in some of the biggest productions in the last few years, including <i>The Girl on the Train, Dune, The Greatest Showman, </i>and the recent installment of the Mission Impossible franchise. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Despite her illustrious professional journey, Rebecca, who turned 40 this October, has managed to stay under the radar. The Swedish actress is a big star in her native, Sweden, and she reckons her international stardom is still newish, making her a less-recognized face amongst the crowd. Ahead is everything you need to know about Ferguson's personal life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Rebecca Ferguson is Happily Married! &nbsp;</h2><p>Ferguson's reprising her role as the disavowed MI6 agent in <i>Mission: Impossible â€“ Dead Reckoning Part One</i> has the audience talking about the actress. Among a trove of things that has been gaining fans' attention are Ferguson's splendid acting chops, her chemistry with <i>Mission Impossible</i>'s poster boy, <strong>Tom Cruise</strong>, and her personal life. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/15/90232505_630387140871508_421766533960201869_n%20(1)-1702638042588.jpg><p>Ferguson's low-key disposition isn't just limited to her professional realm. The Swedish actress, in addition, also leads a low-profile personal life. Rebecca is happily married to her husband, <strong>Rory St. Clair Gainer</strong>, a businessman, who has made several appearances with his famous wife over the years. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The couple reportedly rented a cottage and invited their close family and friends for witnesses. Ferguson shared that her son, from her previous relationship, served as the ring-bearer in the ceremony, while her then-infant daughter, slept her way through the&nbsp;wedding. &nbsp;</p><h2>Rebecca Ferguson and Her Husband Share a Daughter!&nbsp;</h2><p>The couple reportedly started dating in 2016 and decided to go all in after two years. Ferguson may not be much of a divulger but the actress has, at least, shared the basics with her fans. Before embarking on their happily-ever-after, Ferguson and Rory ventured into parenthood when they welcomed a daughter,<strong> Sage</strong>, in early 2018. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/15/56248161_114771229714062_2278371385866849631_n%20(1)-1702638049414.jpg><p>The loved-up spouses have since shared little to nothing about their daughter. Rebecca's marriage with Rory would've remained a secret for a long time had it not been for Ferguson, who opened up about the milestone while promoting her flick,<i> The Kid Who Would Be King</i>. Ferguson <a href=#>shared</a> that she and Rory tied the knot in an intimate ceremony over the holidays in 2018. &nbsp;</p><h2>Rebecca Ferguson Shares a Son with an Ex-Boyfriend! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Ferguson stepped into the realm of fame as a doting mother of one. The actress was trudging her way through the cut-throat business, appearing in <i>Wallander, The White Queen,</i> and a few more while raising her son,<strong> </strong><a href=#>Isac Hallberg</a><strong>,</strong> whom she welcomed with her then-boyfriend, <strong>Ludwig Hallberg</strong>, in 2007. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/15/66893690_431905947402228_3427679742985267082_n%20(1)-1702638056282.jpg><p>Ferguson's son, who is a handsome teenager now, was a young boy when his mother would bring him to her movie sets. He loves it, but I don't think he would like to act," the Golden Globe-nominated actress shared. Not much is known about Rebecca's relationship with Ludiwg except for the fact that the couple spent some years in the Swedish southeast coast, Simrishamn, before breaking up in 2015. &nbsp;</p><h3>Rebecca Ferguson Reveals Her Crush! &nbsp;</h3><p>Who says that married people can't have crushes? The words married and crush might seem off for some people but not for Ferguson, who has no qualms disclosing her Hollywood infatuation.<i> The Girl on the Train</i> actress is now happily married but there was a time she was crushing hard on her co-star Tom Cruise. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/12/15/89393458_596971937700048_8806156454149153646_n%20(1)-1702638069077.jpg><p>Ferguson, who has now developed a pretty close bond with Cruise and hails him as an "inspiration" recently confessed her feelings for the icon. The Swedish actress shared that she started crushing hard on Tom after watching him in 1994's <i>Interview with the Vampire.&nbsp;</i></p><p>When Ferguson was given the lifetime opportunity to star alongside Cruise, she made sure that Tom learned about her infatuation with him. "I told him when we worked together that I had a big crush. I'm sure he was delighted! Who wouldn't be?" said the actress. &nbsp;</p><p>Tom, who has been married and divorced three times, and recently sparked dating rumors with Shakira, was weirdly linked with Ferguson earlier this year after the two were spotted looking joyful at the U.K. premiere of their latest Mission Impossible installment. A source later shared that Cruise has immense love and respect for Rebecca, but he would never cross the line.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqucm52TmK5ussSrnq6rn6PAbrjOr5xmpJmbsm6wyK%2Bgp59dnru1u4ytn55lo6m8s8WMqJ1moJWneqnB0puYp5xdlrulecWapKKkqQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./domonic-wilson.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Domonic Wilson</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./annabelle-ham-s-dead-body-was-dragged-from-water-coroner.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Annabelle Ham's dead body was dragged from water: coroner</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
