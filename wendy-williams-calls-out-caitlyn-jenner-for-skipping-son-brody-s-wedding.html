Brody Jenner spoke about his hard feelings after his father didn’t show up,</p><p class=Zg>“Caitlyn seems to be selfish and self-absorbed,” Williams <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rSjAynf9Zg">said</a>. “I get it, Bruce waited all his life to become Caitlyn, and he did it in front of all of us, and it was a teachable moment. But, there’s no excuse for missing your child’s wedding.”</p><p class=Zg>Brody spoke shared his sentiments over Jenner’s absence during his big day on MTV’s “The Hills: New Beginnings,” calling it a “bummer” and an occurrence that “really did hurt” the actor. He added that perhaps Jenner had “better things to do.”</p><p class=Zg>William’s, on the other hand, did not take the issue lightly and continued to rebut the apparent reason for Jenner not attending the wedding – he didn’t want to distract the crowd. The daytime host highlighted that all Kardashians and Jenner’s are famous, and so no one will really mind.</p><p class=Zg>“People are over it… no one cares about taking pictures with you on Brody’s wedding day. It’s about him!” William’s <a class="zd d" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rSjAynf9Zg">said</a>. “Caitlyn, you’re really not anything special anymore, dear.”</p><p class=Zg>A day before their wedding, Jenner was spotted at an amfAR event in Austria. Kaitlyn Carter revealed on Monday’s episode of “The Hills” that the former Bruce Jenner decided not to go to the wedding a week before the big day.</p><p class=Zg>Eventually, Brody opened up about his relationship with Caitlyn, which was never really good. He added that it was his mother, Linda Thompson, who served as his “rock” through the failures and triumphs he experienced.</p><p class=Zg>Thompson and Jenner <a class="zd d" href=#>were married in 1981</a> and share two children, Brandon and Sam Brody. However, their marriage ended in divorce in 1986. Before Thompson, Jenner had a wife, Chrystie Crownover whom he had two kids with as well – Burt and Casey.</p><p class=Zg>In 1991, Jenner married the famous Kris Kardashian whom he had children, Kendall and Kylie, with. Admittedly, Jenner claimed he barely sees his kids because of their situation and the difficulty of having close relationships with all of them.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmptbGlhZ3q4sc2dsGavmaG5qq3MrGScmZyhwG6vwKKrpbGeYremus2eqWarm569b7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./controversial-ugandan-pastor-aloysius-bugingo-shot-in-murder-attempt.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Controversial Ugandan Pastor Aloysius Bugingo Shot In 'Murder Attempt'</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rihanna-sister-samantha-fenty-relationships-net-worth-songs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rihanna Sister- Samantha Fenty Relationships, Net Worth, Songs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
