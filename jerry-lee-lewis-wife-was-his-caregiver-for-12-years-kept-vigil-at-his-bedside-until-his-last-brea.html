The pair first crossed paths at one of Lewis's concerts in Los Angeles. At the time, Brown was 25 and romantically involved with her ex-husband and the singer's cousin, Rusty.</p><p class=dh>But despite their romance, Lewis still looked at her then-boyfriend, who was also present at the concert, and told him he would marry Brown if Rusty did not. However, after the show, the singer and Rusty's girlfriend did not cross paths again for a long time.</p><p class=dh>Within that period, Lewis tied the knot multiple times. His sixth marriage was to Kerrie McCarver in 1985, which crumbled in 2005, after two decades. Following another failed marriage, Lewis remained single for a while before crossing paths again with Brown in 2010.</p><p class=dh>That year, the pianist suffered serious health issues and was forced to hire Brown as his caregiver. As time progressed, the pair grew closer and closer, becoming more attached to each other. Then, six months after their second meeting, Lewis and Brown started dating.</p><p class=dh>The news of the lovebirds' relationship shocked everyone, as many only thought of Brown as Lewis's caregiver. However, the pair had grown very fond of each other behind the scenes.</p><p class=dh>On December 25, 2010, the singer decided to take his romance with Brown to the next level by giving her a surprise present under the Christmas tree. <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.the-sun.com/entertainment/6539871/who-jerry-lee-lewis-wife-judith-brown/>According to</a> Lewis's caregiver:</p><p class=dh>"He gave me a ring for Christmas but didn't tell me it was an engagement ring until a few months later. He just said, 'I want to let you know that the ring I gave you for Christmas was a promise that I would marry you.'"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/b93534a0f94abc9f1608c74587e81a15.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Jerry Lee Lewis, Ringo Starr and Judith Brown attend the 30th Annual Rock And Roll Hall Of Fame Induction Ceremony at Public Hall on April 18, 2015, in Cleveland, Ohio. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Following the engagement, Lewis suggested that he and his girlfriend tie the knot in Ferriday, Mississippi, in March 2012, to which she agreed. On that day, the couple exchanged wedding vows in a small ceremony surrounded by close family and friends.</p><p class=dh>Brown noted that everything felt like it was meant to be as soon as they sat down in front of the preacher. According to her, neither she nor Lewis felt like they had been previously married, as it seemed like their first time exchanging wedding vows.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/8aae43e686c5c198f1deb2c2a3545cb7.jpg><p class=zj data-testid=image-source>Rock and Roll Hall of Fame musician Jerry Lee Lewis performs onstage at Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts on November 17, 2018, in Cerritos, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=dh>Brown confessed that when they first met and Lewis told Rusty he would marry her, she didn't take his words seriously.

It is important to note that Rusty, Brown's ex-husband, was also Myra's brother.

As a result, Myra stopped seeing Lewis and eventually cut him off from her life.
