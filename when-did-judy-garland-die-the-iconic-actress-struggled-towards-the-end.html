But she died too soon, and her final years were challenging.</p><p class=Fg>Even though Judy Garland passed away over five decades ago, she made headlines again in May 2022 after one of the dresses she wore in "The Wizard of Oz" – worth between $800,000 and $1.2 million – was almost sold in an auction.</p><p class=Fg>However, Barbara Kartke and the Catholic University of America got into a legal battle over its ownership, meaning that nobody could sell the dress until the lawsuit was settled. Part of the reason the piece of clothing is so expensive is Judy Garland's outstanding but short career.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2c9a9273cb16809850d2b7949ff6357d.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Judy Garland circa 1950s | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>WHEN DID JUDY GARLAND DIE?</strong></p><p class=Fg>On June 22, 1969, Garland's fifth husband, <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.latimes.com/local/obituaries/archives/la-me-judy-garland-19690623-story.html>Mickey Deans</a>, found her dead in their London home. She was just 47 years old. Deans was 35 at the time, and he had to break down their bathroom door to get to her.</p><p class=Fg>Authorities later revealed that Garland passed away due to an accidental self-administered overdose of barbiturates. They pointed out that Garland did not <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a29254579/judy-garland-death-true-story/>die by suicide</a>.</p><p class=Fg>It is essential to point out that Garland always struggled with mental health problems. By the time she was 23, she had already gone through psychiatric treatments and experienced three nervous breakdowns.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/7e8360ac969fe0959baa59cfe9df8a03.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Judy Garland on July 31, 1967 in New York City | Source: Getty Images</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>HOW WERE JUDY GARLAND'S FINAL MONTHS?</strong></p><p class=Fg>Judy Garland debuted as an actress aged two, and she hit so many highs and lows throughout her career that she was described as Hollywood's queen of comebacks. She also struggled with addiction and depression for most of her life.</p><p class=Fg>Garland revealed her mother started giving her pills to either keep her energy up or help her sleep when she was ten. MGM supposedly did the same with her and other actors to keep up with their grueling schedules.</p><p class=Fg>In 1954, Garland appeared in her last iconic film, "A Star is Born." Things slowly spiraled out of control after that. She played solo concerts to pay off thousands of dollars she owed to the IRS in back taxes, but the shows lacked quality.</p><p class=Fg>She frequently showed up late, and her performances were erratic. Garland's manager, Stevie Phillips, revealed that she needed drugs to do things as simple as talk and sign contracts by the end of her life.</p><p class=Fg>Judy Garland's final performance was in Copenhagen, Denmark, in late March 1969. Her addiction problems were so severe that she met her fifth husband, Mickey Deans, when he delivered stimulants to her hotel room a few months before dying.</p><p class=Fg><strong class=Dg>WHO ARE JUDY GARLAND'S CHILDREN?</strong></p><p class=Fg>Garland's <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://hollywoodlife.com/feature/judy-garland-kids-4728886/>love life</a> was far from perfect. Before Deans, she was married to musician David Rose, stage and film director Vincente Minnelli, businessman Sidney Luft, and actor Mark Herron.</p><p class=Fg>Minnelli and Garland welcomed one child together, Liza, in 1946. In 1952 and 1955, Garland gave birth to her and Luft's children, Lorna and Joey.</p><p class=Fg>Out of Judy Garland's three kids, <a class="Xd a" href=#>Liza</a> is the most famous. She became a singer and actress and even took home an Academy Award for playing Sally Bowles in "Cabaret."</p><p class=Fg>Lorna is also involved in the entertainment industry. She made her Broadway debut in the early 1970s but mainly focused on her music career. Joey is "camera shy," according to his sisters, so information about him is scarce. Rest in peace, legend.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmtwaWxpZnq4tMSnZJ2hlGK3trDYZp6aqpyWu6V5w6KcZqyYmnqqr86noJxlkZjBb7TTpqM%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./beyonc%C3%A9-s-famous-half-sister-shares-photo-of-rarely-seen-mom-who-is-just-as-gorgeous-as-she-is.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Beyonc's famous half-sister shares photo of rarely-seen mom who is just as gorgeous as she is</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./usher.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Usher</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
