He had battled mental illness for some time and tragically passed away from an apparent suicide this past Sunday. This has left his family and friends in Saint Charles heartbroken; there is an immense amount of pain that accompanies the sudden loss of one so young. Depression and anxiety can be fatal if ignored or not treated soon enough. The passing of Austin is a devastating reminder to us all about the dangers of untreated mental health issues amongst our youth today. No words can adequately express the state of shock that overtook his community in Saint Charles as they mourned their lost son, friend, father, and brother.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-112 data-inserter-version=2></span><p><strong>Kimmie Lavinghouse&nbsp; Wrote,</strong></p><p>Waking up this morning to the news of Austin’s passing was a different thing to understand.
