Her parents, Ira Peskowitz and Barbara Ann Bregoli, had barely been dating for a year when their daughter was born. They shared a house in Boyton Beach, Florida for a while after Bhabie arrived. They divorced shortly after, when the young rapper was only a baby.</p><p>So, what caused her parents’ divorce? Many have accused her father, Ira, of abandoning his child and daughter’s mother. However, due to a lack of proof, this has yet to be established.</p><h2><span id=Bhabie_was_only_four_years_old_when_her_mother_was_diagnosed_with_cancer_she_had_a_difficult_childhood>Bhabie was only four years old when her mother was diagnosed with cancer; she had a difficult childhood.</span></h2><p>Bregoli lived exclusively with her mother in their Florida home after her parents divorced. Barbara Ann and her mother lived a great life together until she was stricken with cancer in 2007. Bhabie was only four years old at the time.</p><p>Because Ann could only rely on her daughter, Danielle took over as her mother’s primary carer. The small girl had to spread aloe on her mother’s chest every day to soothe her agony from cancer treatments and other things going on around the house.</p><p>Barbara’s cancer was also in remission by late 2007. Despite this, she had not recovered sufficiently to return to work. So she and her daughter survived for a long time on insurance, child support, and assistance from Ann’s family.</p><p>Bhabie even told the Palm Beach Post how she felt during those difficult moments. She stated,</p><p>“Sometimes you think you’re alone, but there are a lot of moms out there who deserve to be recognized.” It’s difficult to be alone. A father is a father, but a mother is the one who bears a kid. She looks after that child. You will always be a mother. That will never change.”</p><p>Unfortunately, her mother’s cancer returned when Bhad Bhabie was only 11 years old. According to her mother, this return was the catalyst for her rebellious conduct.</p><h2><span id=Did_Danielle8217s_mother_Barbara_Ann_really_take_advantage_of_her_fame>Did Danielle’s mother, Barbara Ann, really take advantage of her fame?</span></h2><p>Bhabie began to act out as a result of his shattered family and unhappy childhood. As a young girl, she was continually changing schools, and nothing in her life was steady. As a result, she became quite a rebel after the sixth grade.</p><p>Danielle, it turns out, became a full-fledged criminal around the age of 10-11 when she stole her mother’s automobile. She was promptly arrested as a result of this. As a result, she began her life as a felon, and her mother believed that the justice system had failed her.</p><p>Soon after, Bhabie’s mother, Barbara Ann, phoned Dr. Phil. She wished to give her daughter the justice she deserved, but the show depicted her negatively. Everyone began to accuse her of being a mother who had abandoned her own child.</p><p>Ann’s attitude toward her daughter shifted just a year later, when Bhad Bhabie became renowned. After many thought she had given up on Danielle, she had suddenly begun to embrace her offspring. She also had an explanation ready for her detractors after the accusations were made public.</p><p>Barbara Ann stated:</p><p>“I placed my daughter on that show in order to save her life.” These people don’t know what a hole in the wall is. Have they ever approached me? Have they ever sat in my daughter’s seat? No. But they’ll despise her now. Do you understand why? She has a distinct personality. She has a talent.”</p><p>It’s disheartening to think that a mother is exploiting their child for fame. We sincerely hope that this is not the case for Bhabie and her mother.</p><h2><span id=Why_didn8217t_Bhabie_grow_up_with_her_father_He_Forsook_His_Own_Daughter>Why didn’t Bhabie grow up with her father? He Forsook His Own Daughter</span></h2><p>Ira Preskowitz has been absent from Bregoli’s life since the beginning. We might even say she has a strained relationship with her biological father. However, Ira enters the picture in 2018.</p><p>Mr. Peskowitz said in a video aired in 2018 that he had been in a custody dispute with Bhabie’s mother since 2003. Furthermore, he emphasized that he did not abandon his only daughter, but rather gave up custody of her after becoming frustrated with the court and legal bills. In addition, he attacked his ex-partner’s approach to raising their kid.</p><p>Similarly, Bhabie’s father stated that he had signed his daughter up for his health insurance and attempted to enroll her in treatment. Ira also stated that he want for her to be closer to her half-siblings and stepmother.</p><p>Despite this, many people accused her father of trying to profit financially from his daughter’s growing celebrity. Ira, on the other hand, rejected these allegations and assured everyone that he released the video out of love for his precious daughter.</p><h2><span id=What_Was_The_Reason_For_Bhad_Bhabie_Almost_Obtaining_A_Restraining_Order_Against_Her_Father>What Was The Reason For Bhad Bhabie Almost Obtaining A Restraining Order Against Her Father?</span></h2><p>Bhabie posted a message to her father at the start of 2020. According to research, it was a response to Ira’s Facebook post saying that Bregoli’s mother was abusive.</p><p>Furthermore, the rapper did not remain silent. She accused her father of abandoning her mother and marrying a stripper he met in Canada in her Instagram post. Furthermore, she said that Mr. Peskowitz created the post in order to gain attention.</p><p>As a result, she sought a restraining order against him.</p><h2><span id=Bregoli8217s_father_Ira_Peskowitz_said_that_she_was_8220groomed8221_to_become_an_adult_star>Bregoli’s father, Ira Peskowitz, said that she was “groomed” to become an adult star.</span></h2><p>Danielle Bregoli’s father discussed how his daughter was “groomed” to become an adult star in an interview with The Sun. During the interview, he made remarks on how she dressed and acted, and how he assumed that everything she did was sex-related.</p><p>This interview was released after Bhabie allegedly started an OnlyFans account. Her father was dissatisfied with the way she was currently making money. This also added to the turbulence of the Bregoli-Peskowitz family drama.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: M.
