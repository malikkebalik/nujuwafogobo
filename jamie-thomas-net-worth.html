According to authoritative sources, it has been estimated that Jamie`s net worth is as high as $50 million, earned through his successful career as a skateboarder and as a businessman.</p><h3><span id=What_was_his_early_life_before_fame>What was his early life before fame?</span></h3><p>Jamie grew up in his hometown, and became interested in skateboarding when he was in his teens. As he got older, his interest became far greater and in 1992 he moved to San Francisco, California, as he wanted to become a professional skateboarder. He acquired several sponsorships, including from Thunder Tricks, Vans, Spitfire Wheels, and Real Skateboarders.</p><h3><span id=How_did_he_became_famous>How did he became famous?</span></h3><p>He became a professional when he joined the skateboard brand Experience, but soon after he switched teams and joined the San Diego-based Invisible Skateboards, moving to Southern California in 1994, and soon he found himself on the covers of the TransWorld SKATEboarding magazine, while also filming videos for Spitfire Wheels and Invisible Skateboards. This only encouraged him to continue with his career, and in 1995 he joined Toy Machine Skateboards, led by skateboarder <a href=#>Ed Templeton</a>. While with them he filmed and directed a couple of videos for the brand, one of which was “Welcome To Hell”, the most influential videos of the ‘90s. All these activities added to his growing net worth.</p><p>In 1996, Jamie ventured into skateboarding on his own, starting the brand Zero Skateboards, which would be distributed through Tum Yeto. He filmed several videos for Zero Skateboards brand, including “Zero: Thrill of it All” in 1997, “Zero: Misled Youth” (1999), “Zero: Dying to Live” (2002), “Zero: New Blood” (2005), “Zero: Strange World” (2009), and “Zero: Cold War” (2013). This filming also significantly increased his net worth.</p><p>Furthermore, back in 2003 he started the footwear brand Fallen Footwear, and thanks to his business ventures, he won the Entrepreneur of the Year” award given by the Ersnt & Young. Most recently, he announced that the skateboarding company Dwindle Distribution would take over production, finance, and sales of his brand, but the name Zero would remain.</p><h3><span id=What_is_James_family_wife_and_children>What is James family: wife and children?</span></h3><p>Regarding his personal life, Jamie is married to Joanne and the couple has three children together.
