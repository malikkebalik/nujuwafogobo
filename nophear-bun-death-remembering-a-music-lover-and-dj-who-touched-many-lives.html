You were such a bright beam of light and seeing your beautiful self run up to me always made me so so happy 🧡 I’m sad that we’ll never get to hang out and do the things we had planned. I’m sad that we won’t ever get to go on rides together again. Im sad that we won’t coincidentally run into each other every time you lose your group and run off on our own adventures for a bit. I’m just sad to be without you. I was going through our old messages and found this video you sent me of us on the gliders that I had never seen before and it sent me into a puddle. I love you so much and I hope you’re resting easy. Please visit me in my dreams until we meet again. 🧡 I met Nono at paradiso 2019 when she had separated from her group and was anxiously looking for them. I gave her my favorite pashmina and a crystal, helped her look for her people and then we didn’t even bother because we were inseperable the rest of the night. We danced, ran around, went on rides, laughed, experienced amazing sets together, and all of the other fun festival things we possibly could in just that one night. Every other show we ran into each other at it happened to be when she had lost her group (I think I only found her with her group one time) so it was always our ongoing joke. “Oh I found you! That makes sense why I lost my friends”. It was always like the world just conveniently placed us next to each other whenever we unknowingly needed the other’s energy. My heart hurts knowing that it won’t happen again, don’t take the little moments with your friends for granted and love them extra hard. 🥺<h3 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=Nophear_Bun_Obituary></span><strong>Nophear Bun Obituary </strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Nophear Bun’s sudden departure is a stark reminder of the fragility of life.
