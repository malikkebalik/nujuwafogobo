Today, the Duchess of Sussex, 39, is well-known for her role as Rachel Zane on the TV series Suits, as well as guest appearances on various TV shows and supporting roles in movies like Horrible Bosses. Ever since she married <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Prince Harry</strong></a>, however, her profile has completely shifted to one of her greatest passions: public service and humanitarian work. But let’s take a look back to how it all began, with Meghan’s role on Deal or No Deal.</p><h2><strong>What Is ‘Deal Or No Deal?’</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-deal-or-no-deal-start-embed2.jpg>Deal or No Deal is the American iteration of the Dutch game show of the same name. The show started in 2005 in America and was featured on NBC and CNBC until its final episodes in 2019.&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Howie Mandel</strong></a> hosted as the long-time host of the game show, which featured contestants choosing and eliminating cases with values of money from $.01 to $1,000,000. Contestants were also given the option to take a specific cash value from ‘The Banker,’ or continue on with the game, leaving with a final sum of money.<h2><strong>When Was Meghan Markle On ‘Deal Or No Deal?’</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/meghan-markle-deal-or-no-deal-start-embed1.jpg>Meghan Markle made her first appearance as a briefcase girl on Deal or No Deal in April 2006. The future Suits&nbsp;star appeared in more than 30 episodes of the game show, as the briefcase model for cases numbered 11, 12, and 24. Meghan’s final episode was in February 2007, after less than a year on the show. Only a few short years later, Meghan’s acting career reached new heights when she was cast as Rachel Zane on Suits&nbsp;in 2011.<h2><strong>Who Did Meghan Work With On ‘Deal Or No Deal?’</strong></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-5>During Meghan’s time on&nbsp;the game show&nbsp;Deal or No Deal, her path actually crossed with model&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Chrissy Teigen</strong></a>, who also appeared on the show as a briefcase girl and has since become a huge supporter of the Duchess of Sussex. But Meghan’s time on the show also aligned with <strong>Lisa Gleave</strong>, who spoke with &nbsp;Gold Coast Bulletin&nbsp;about Meghan’s time on the show. “I remember her being very focused on her acting career and her role as a briefcase beauty, as we were called, was just a stepping stone in her career,” Lisa shared, per&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Harper’s Bazaar</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>“She only did a few seasons and then landed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her role on Suits</a> which took her away. I was so happy for her when I heard about the marriage,” she said. Meghan, herself, has spoken about her time on the show, as well. The Duchess likened the role as a learning experience, one <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>that led her to&nbsp;Suits</a>. “I would put that in the category of things I was doing while I was auditioning to try to make ends meet,” Meghan told&nbsp;Esquire in July 2013.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>“I went from working in the U.S. Embassy in Argentina to ending up on&nbsp;Deal. It’s run the gamut,” she explained. “Definitely working on Deal or No Deal&nbsp;was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing. So if that’s a way for me to gloss over that subject, then I will happily shift gears into something else.” Host Howie Mandel also spoke about Meghan’s brief time on the show, and you can check out his funny conversation with&nbsp;<strong>Ellen DeGeneres</strong> above.</p><h2><strong>Meghan Markle’s ‘Deal Or No Deal’ Briefcase Was Up For Sale</strong></h2><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p id=content-paragraph-8>While her time on the show has long passed, Meghan’s role as a briefcase girl on&nbsp;Deal or No Deal still lives on. In December 2019, the #24 briefcase that Meghan held for the latter part of her time on the series went up for auction via Profiles in History’s&nbsp;<a class=external-link title="(opens new window)" href=# rel="noopener nofollow" aria-describedby=external-disclaimer data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hollywood: A Collector’s Ransom auction</a>, according to&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>People</a>. At the time, the prop for the game show was listed at #783 on the auction list and was expected to be sold for a price tag between $4,000 and $6,000.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>The briefcase, which was Meghan’s prop for roughly 31 episodes, measured 16 x 12 x 2 inches. There were a number of other auction items up for sale when the profile went public, but given Meghan’s new status, at the time, as a member of the Royal Family, fans were definitely interested. Meghan’s life has drastically changed since she was a part of the long-running game show.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>Following her role as Rachel Zane on&nbsp;Suits, Meghan wed Prince Harry in May 2018. The couple welcomed their first child, son&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Archie Harrison Mountbatten-Windsor</strong></a>, one year later in May 2019. On Valentine’s Day, February 14, 2021, the couple revealed that they were expecting their second child, following <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a tragic miscarriage</a> Meghan suffered during the summer of 2020. During Meghan and Prince Harry March 7 CBS tell-all interview with&nbsp;<strong>Oprah Winfrey</strong>, the couple revealed that they would <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>welcome a baby girl</a> some time in the summer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8yenqGZnmK6or7KpZxmnJWWuW670WalqGWUmq6teZNsa21tZ2p8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./antitrust-investigation-into-k-pop-production-triggers-temporary-decline-in-k-pop-stocks.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Antitrust Investigation into K-Pop Production Triggers Temporary Decline in K-Pop Stocks!</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./uhuru-park-to-be-handed-back-to-nairobi-county-government-on-thursday.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Uhuru Park To Be Handed Back To Nairobi County Government On Thursday</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./erna-schneider-hoover.html>Erna Schneider Hoover</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./leaked-tiktok-document-exposes-sad-secret-to-addictive-feeds.html>Leaked TikTok document exposes 'sad' secret to addictive feeds</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./armageddon-actress-tyler-crossword-clue-and-answer.html>&amp;quot;Armageddon&amp;quot; actress Tyler: Crossword Clue and Answer</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./cartel-violence-and-brutality-exposed-the-talks-today.html>Cartel Violence and Brutality Exposed The Talks Today</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./devanne-j-villareal-2023-update.html>Devanne J Villareal [2023 Update]</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeVib.
